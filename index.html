    <p1 style="font-size:150%">Fancy learning Italian in a fun way? Italiano In Canto is an opportunity to improve Italian
      using the power of music. Embark on a journey into the rich tradition of Italian singer-songwriter music and learn
      and remeber useful sets of words and sentences. 
      Songs are memorable- they are designed to be remembered over a long time, and 
      the tell us stories about the places and event that populate the imagery of Italian 
      speakers worldwide. We find that learning Italian through singing helps language 
      learners associate expressions with emotions and their context, which we find a 
      natural and fun way to learn a language. Our sessions do not require either 
      singing or prior Italian language skills, and is not intended to improve your
      singing (or ours), but just to play with Italian alongside fellow language learners xx</p1>
