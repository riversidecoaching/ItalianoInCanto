<p1 style="font-size:150%">Fancy learning Italian in a fun way? Italiano In Canto is a method to enrich your language skills using the power of music. Embark on a journey into Italian music, learn and remeber useful sets of words and sentences. Songs are memorable- they are designed to be remembered over a long time, and the tell us stories about the places and event that populate the imagery of Italian speakers worldwide. We find that learning Italian through singing helps language learners associate expressions with emotions and their context, which is the way anyone learns their own language. Also, it tends be quite fun.</p1>
