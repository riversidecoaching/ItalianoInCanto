<h1 style="font-size:200%">Learning Italian just got a lot easier!</h1>
<br>
<p1 style="font-size:150%">Fancy learning Italian in a fun way? Italiano In Canto is an opportunity to improve Italian using the power of music. Embark on a journey into Italian music, learn and remeber useful sets of words and sentences. Songs are memorable- they are designed to be remembered over a long time, and the tell us stories about the places and event that populate the imagery of Italian speakers worldwide. We find that learning Italian through singing helps language learners associate expressions with emotions and their context, which we find a natural and fun way to learn a language. Our sessions do not require either singing or prior Italian language skills, and is not intended to improve your singing (or ours), but just to play with Italian alongside fellow language learners xx</p1>
